# Criteria

## Project conditions

  - Problem to be addressed by the project must be thoroughly formulated.
  - Requirements should be investigated in a realistic setting involving 2 or more informants none of which are students or lecturers. The purpose is to investigate a context for a new application with which the students are unfamiliar.
  - Requirements models, designs, and program must be object-oriented.
  - Requirements should be explored through interviews with potential users and through prototypes evaluated by potential users. Requirements should thus be documented with both object oriented models and with prototypes.
  - Designs should include both software architecture and interaction designs.
  - Program should be with all necessary parts and relevant data.
  - Tests should cover the program to a reasonable and explainable degree.
  - Interaction design should be explored through prototypes and usability should be evaluated systematically. 

## Reports

### Development report

  - The requirements (in terms of models and prototypes), including how they were identified and selected, how they were explore and validated through prototyping, and how they were modelled.
  - The design (in terms of architecture and interaction), including arguments for the design and evaluation of its appropriateness. The design should cover all requirements unless explicitly declared in the report.
  - The program (in terms of a complete source and a running system that can be demonstrated), including arguments for the detailed program design, algorithms, and datatypes. The program should cover all requirements and design unless explicitly declared in the report.
  - The quality assurance (in terms of program tests and results and of usability evaluation and results), including arguments for its the coverage and validity.

### Academic report 

  - A description of the development project and a reflection on its particulars
  - The most important experiences gained during the project work with an emphasis of its critical evaluation

# Exam
Project completion will be held right before the exam. The project completion should present the main results of the project and should also include a demonstration of the running software. Any further material, e.g., slides used in the presentation, should be handed out at the project completion. There should be opportunity for all participants in the project completion to try and experience the software.

The exam is individual and can cover all of the project report, developed software, and any further material supplied to the examiner and censor.
